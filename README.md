### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone [repository-url]
cd next-app-auth
```

2. Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your application should now be running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Project Structure

- `pages/` - This directory contains all the pages of your Next.js application.
  - `api/` - API routes are located here. We've got the `login` API route that checks the credentials and returns a JWT.
  - `dashboard.js` - Represents the dashboard page which is shown to the user once they're authenticated.
  - `login.js` - Contains the login form.
  - `index.js` (or `page.js`) - Home page that redirects users based on their authentication status.

- `package.json` - Lists the project dependencies and contains scripts for development, build, and test.

### Authentication Flow

1. The user navigates to the login page and enters their credentials.
2. Upon clicking the login button, a request is sent to the `/api/login` route.
3. This route checks the credentials and, if valid, returns a JWT.
4. This token is then saved to local storage and used to determine if the user is authenticated throughout the app.
5. If the user navigates to the dashboard, their authentication status is checked using the presence of the JWT in local storage.
6. A logout button on the dashboard allows the user to remove their token from local storage and be redirected to the login page.

### Dependencies

- `next` - The React framework for building the application.
- `jsonwebtoken` - Used for generating and verifying JWTs.
- `react`, `react-dom` - React library.
- Dev dependencies include various tools and libraries to help with styling, testing, and transpilation.

### Scripts

- `dev`: Runs the development server.
- `build`: Builds the production version of the app.
- `start`: Starts the production server.
- `lint`: Lints the codebase using Next.js lint.
- `test`: Runs tests using Jest.
